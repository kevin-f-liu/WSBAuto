['You learn a lot of things—few of them pleasant—when selling a house. When I put\xa0my brownstone on the market a few years ago, I hired a team of professional window cleaners to come and give my windows a good going over. Burly guys with the precision of figure skaters ran soapy squeegees and T-bars encased in fluffy sleeves over the glass, doing more to improve the look of my home than all the dusting, mopping, and HGTV-inspired staging I could muster.\xa0', 'The lesson was twofold: Clean windows make a huge difference, and keeping them that way is harder than it looks, especially if you’re doing it yourself. That’s why cleaning the windows of my apartment has earned a perpetual place at the top of my to-do list, above even the more necessary tasks of repainting and regrouting.', 'And so I was thrilled when I saw the Winbot 950—essentially, a Roomba broken free of gravity. While the field of floor cleaners is cluttered, far fewer companies have gone vertical: There’s the ', '\xa0and the skyscraper-ready ', ', by Swiss company Serbot\xa0AG, and that’s about it. How would this device, made by Chinese robotics company Ecovacs\xa0Robotics, keep my windows sparkling without squeegee acrobatics on my part?', 'The Winbot 950 works by affixing itself to a pane of glass, using an inbuilt fan for suction, like a vacuum, and moving itself around with a pair of rubber tank treads. Surrounding the fan and treads is a circular squeegee, and then a removable, washable, microfiber cloth that you spritz with a spray window cleaner. There are edge sensors in the corner\xa0and a handle on top with a start/pause button.', 'Since the Winbot 950 is rather large—about 11 inches square\xa0and just shy of five\xa0pounds—it must be plugged in\xa0to maintain sufficient suction to keep it attached. It has enough battery power to keep itself on the window for 15\xa0minutes, should power go out amid cleaning.\xa0The 14-foot-long\xa0power cord determines the theoretical limit to the window size a\xa0Winbot can clean: about 175 square feet.', 'My double-hung windows, however, were considerably smaller, with each pane of glass about 3.5 feet\xa0square. I plugged in the Winbot and held it up to the glass and pressed the start button. It took just under four minutes to clean the 12-and-a-quarter square feet I’d assigned it. At one point, the border of a rolled up shade created a barrier it couldn’t see or navigate away from. It beeped balefully until I used the included remote control to manually guide it back down to a place at which I could restart the cleaning.', 'Cleaning the outsides of my third-story windows necessitated use of the included tether, which fixes to the Winbot\xa0at\xa0one end and to glass on the other, using a large suction cup. For a moment, I imagined the Winbot losing grip and bungee jumping off my building, maybe swinging through my downstairs neighbor’s window like a wrecking ball. That, fortunately, never happened. It just sucked on, like a household ramora, and puttered about for an additional four minutes.', 'Was it worth the $400 price tag? Perhaps if I had giant, flat picture windows, it would be. As things are, I’m better off making do with my Windex and squeegee.\xa0Or just leave it to the professionals.']

['A rendering of a “private submersible yacht” by ', '\xa0Private Submersible Yachts, an Austrian company.', 'Source: Migaloo', 'For those bored with\xa0multimillion-dollar\xa0megayachts, with their ho-hum helipads\xa0and snooze-inducing\xa0jacuzzis, consider the 928-foot-long M7, designed by the Austrian company,\xa0Migaloo\xa0Private Submersible Yachts.', 'If you’re the helipad-on-a-sea-vessel type, the M7 not only has a place for your chopper to land, it has a swimming pool, VIP suites, multiple hangar bays, and a design inspired by the U.S. Navy’s ', '. (Alas, its engines are diesel-electric, not nuclear-powered.)', 'And unlike a yacht, which is just going to sit there on top of the water, floating around like a $200 million chunk of burnished driftwood, the M7 can dive to 1,500 feet and cruise underwater\xa0at 20 knots. The real excitement, as Sebastian the Crab once sang, is “under the sea.”', 'Life may be better down where it’s wetter, but the M7 will cost you. There’s no precise price tag yet, says Christian Gumpold, chief executive\xa0officer of\xa0Migaloo.\xa0But\xa0the $2.3 billion figure mentioned in this ', ' is close. “This would make it for sure to the most expensive private object worldwide,” Gumpold\xa0told us via\xa0email.', 'The M7 is not the only submarine available to those rich enough to afford one. For a couple of decades, companies such as Triton Submarines, DeepFlight Adventures, U-Boat Worx\xa0BV, and Seamagine\xa0Hydrospace Corp. have been producing and selling “submersibles.” These are smaller vehicles,\xa0capable of taking from two to eight passengers\xa0thousands of feet down to explore the ocean for hours at a time. OceanGate\xa0Inc., founded by the adventure-loving entrepreneur Stockton Rush, is ', ' to take passengers to the remains of the ', ' in 2018.', 'Submersibles can’t, however, regenerate their own power, and they rely on yachts or other vessels for long-distance transport and servicing. They’re pretty awesome, but they’re more James Cameron, less James Bond.', 'Full-on, luxurious, yacht-style submarines are a more recent development. Three companies—', ', the Florida-based ', ', and ', '\xa0in the Netherlands—produce sub designs\xa0that aspiring Bond villains dream of: capable of traveling 1,000 miles or more, luxuriously appointed, and the kind of underwater headquarters from which you can plot world domination, or maybe just host friends for a week of exploration.', 'As you might expect, private submarines are phenomenally expensive. U.S. Submarines’ Nomad 1000—which seats 10 to 24, has a range of 1,000 nautical miles, and can dive to 1,000 feet—begins at $6.5 million. Its top-of-the-line, 213-foot-long Phoenix 1000, which has more than 5,000 square feet of interior, is estimated to cost $90 million.', 'So while dozens of private submersibles are bobbing around the deep, there are currently no private luxury subs in existence. For all the renderings zipping around the Internet, subs such as the M7 and the Phoenix 1000 remain (mostly) theoretical.', '“We’re not building anything right now,” said\xa0L. Bruce Jones, the founder and CEO of U.S. Submarines, adding that his company, which is affiliated with Triton, is focusing on submersibles “because that’s where the market is.”', '“It seems like a massively expensive engineering exercise—and an unproven one—in the recreational sector,” said\xa0Stewart Campbell, editor of ', '. “Yachting is often a volume game—how much space can you pack into your hull and superstructure? There’s a cost-per-gross-tonne calculation that the superyacht world understands. I imagine with one of these big submersibles, that equation goes out the window. You’re not getting much volume for the money, and the equivalent yacht will give you more of everything.”', 'It’s also possible that safety concerns hinder potential buyers, though all sub makers adhere to safety standards issued by organizations such as the ', ' and the Norwegian ', ', as well as\xa0the U.S. Navy’s Subsafe specifications. They all also claim perfect records, with about 1 million passengers per year going on dives as tourists.', 'Of the three manufacturers, only Ocean Submarine (which supplies subs to the military)\xa0 is\xa0under contract to complete a civilian vessel, for what CEO Martin van Eijk calls “a very rich client.” Set to be delivered in 2018, the 64-foot Neyk L3 can seat up to 20 passengers, depending on the configuration, with a bar, galley, and library. (Van Eijk did not know which books will go into\xa0the library.)', 'The L3 may be smaller than Migaloo’s offerings, but its size offers some advantages. The company’s idea of luxury is, according to its brochures, about “more than Connolly leather.” As with, say, a Lamborghini, this is about comfort and control: Vertical thrusters let the L3 remain in one place, despite ocean currents; landing gear allows the sub to pull up on beaches (no marina necessary); and the ride is quiet and precise, with a range of 500 to 1,500 nautical miles. Plus, it’s only 20 million euros\xa0($23.8 million), practically a bargain. (Buy two!)', 'Learning to pilot these subs—or rather, training a crew to pilot them—is essential. In the U.S., pilots need to have a master’s license, but there’s more to it than that. “When a\xa0submarine is on the surface, it’s the same like another ship,” van Eijk said. “But when you go down under, you need some rules to understand.”', 'Ocean Submarines, he said, has a German training center, with the same simulator as airplanes. “We can do the same interior as the cockpits, so the client can see how exactly the submarine will work,” he said. The training typically takes four months.', 'Once you’ve got your sub and your trained crew, you can go wherever you like, the manufacturers told me. There are no specific legal restrictions on civilian subs anywhere in the world. Which is not to say coast guards won’t take note\xa0of your presence.', '“When you bring a submersible into someone else’s territorial waters, not everybody is as enthusiastic about allowing you to go diving,” said\xa0Patrick Lahey, the founder and president of ', '. “The areas that people seem to be most concerned about submersibles being used are Greece and France, because they have antiquities on the bottom and they’re concerned that a person that owns a submersible might be going down and taking things that might be an important part of history.” (Mechanical grabbing arms and diver lock-out chambers are popular add-ons for most subs.)', 'There is a way to assuage\xa0concerns, Lahey said.\xa0“Involve the local authorities in what you’re doing, both to assure them you’re not there to plunder their antiquities but to give them an opportunity to dive in their own waters and to see things maybe they’ve never seen themselves.”', 'If that doesn’t work, you could always invite them for a dip in one of your jacuzzis, or a midnight screening of the new Star Wars movie at your sub’s open-air cinema. And if the paparazzi show up to spy, you can do what mere superyacht owners never can: Dive.']

In the past three years, the company generated enough excess cash to buy back $30 billion of its own shares.', 'But using equity instead of cash does have its advantages. It allows Boeing to conserve its free cash flow -- a key metric for investors -- by transferring Treasury shares that were repurchased at\xa0far lower values than today’s prices. In addition, Boeing will get a $700 million tax benefit, which will offset the cost of its $500 million cash contribution.', 'The strategy shows how Boeing can “look at risk differently, be proactive and manage that today, and take that uncertainty out over the next five years,” Greg Smith, Boeing’s chief financial officer and chief strategist, told an investor conference on\xa0Aug. 9.', 'It’s not the first time Boeing has plowed stock into its underfunded pension.

But why leverage blockchain technology instead of creating a traditional startup? “It’s the future,” she said. “Why would I want to go back to an old Excel spreadsheet that can be tampered with?” The public ledger that backs Paragon will also provide total transparency to government regulators in both financial and drug-enforcement areas, she said.', '“I want to set the bar high,” she said. “This industry deserves more respect.

According to an internal spreadsheet of base salaries reported on\xa0by the New York Times, women are paid 4 percent\xa0to 6 percent less than men at nearly every job level at Google. The company is also under investigation by the U.S. Labor Department, which alleges widespread gender-based discrepancies in pay. (Google, which declined to comment for this article, has denied these accusations.)', 'Mehrotra\xa0was also at Google in August when a 10-page, 3,300 word manifesto written by one of the company’s software engineers went public. The memo’s main conclusion was that women are underrepresented in tech because their biological differences from men tend to make them less suitable for the job.', '“I’ve really struggled with what to make of that,” Mehortra says. She says she felt nothing but encouragement and support at Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and yet, here was definitive proof that at least some employees believed her gender might play a role in her ability to do the job well. “I read the memo. I saw how the other women at the company were so upset. I overheard their conversations.”', 'It’s\xa0been a particularly\xa0restive moment for women in technology.\xa0In\xa0addition to the Google memo, there’s also been the unending debacle at Uber Technologies Inc. and another brewing at Social Finance Inc., along with sexual harassment allegations at venture capital firms including Greylock, Ignition Partners and\xa0Binary Capital. In July, 500 Startups’ founder resigned and apologized for “being a creep.”', 'This adds up to more than a social or legal concern for tech companies.

Silicon Valley firms claim to want more women; many of them are enthusiastically funding science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)\xa0programs for school-aged girls, hosting all-female hackathons and launching internship programs tailored to women and minorities, including the one Mehrotra\xa0participated in at Google. But only 18 percent\xa0of computer science graduates are women (at Stanford, the number is higher, at 30 percent) and if a significant number of them eschew a company because of its bad reputation, there won’t be many left to choose from.', 'The dozen or so women interviewed for this story differentiated between the general aura of misogyny they see as\xa0prevalent in tech and more specific situations like the one at Uber where, former employees allege, multiple complaints of rampant harassment and retaliation were routinely ignored.', '“I’d never accept an offer from Uber, ever,” says Courtney Thurston, a computer science major at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who’s currently interning at Microsoft Corp. “I’d be very reluctant to work at Uber,” echoes Pierson, from Stanford.

She says she turned down an offer from Palantir Technologies Inc. over political concerns. Palantir co-founder\xa0Peter Thiel is one of President Trump’s few outspoken supporters in Silicon Valley and, Sankar says, “I’m very anti-Trump in my beliefs.”', 'Issues like Google’s, on the other hand, have yet to become the\xa0deal-breaker that Uber’s might be. Many women say they’ve already encountered similar instances of sexism at school or in their own fledgling careers and aren’t surprised to see them flare up at\xa0major companies,\xa0too. “I’ve encountered people who believe some of what was in [the Google memo],” says Julia Di, 21, who’s studying electrical engineering and computer science at Columbia University and has interned at both NASA and Lockheed Martin Corp. “Even my freshman year coding class had a lot of guys who were condescending.”', 'Women’s willingness to pursue careers in spite\xa0of rampant sexism shouldn’t be read as complacency. One Brigham Young University student refused a job offer from a small startup because it didn’t have a formal sexual harassment policy.

['The torrent of dirty water coming out of almost every American oil well is the next big bet for a former fund manager for billionaire Paul Allen.', 'Getting rid of wastewater from onshore wells has become an increasingly costly problem for oil producers as U.S. crude output surged in recent years, especially in the new shale fields from Texas to North Dakota. Drillers typically get about seven barrels of water for every one of oil, and some struggle to deal with the overflow that is mostly sent by truck to disposal sites miles away.', 'David Capobianco, a former managing director for Allen’s ', ', is trying to change that by building pipelines to get wastewater out. His newly formed ', '\xa0aims to be a water-management company for oilfields.\xa0The firm is considering a public share listing within a year to 18 months, taking advantage of a U.S. shale boom that the government expects will boost crude production close to 10 million barrels a day next year.', '“Next to profitability and safety, water may well be the next most important topic for an oil company,” said Laura Capper, chief executive officer at EnergyMakers Advisory Group, an industry consultancy in Houston. “It has risen to the forefront over the last five years unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”', 'To get a sense of just how much water is involved, consider the forecasts for rising oil output in the Permian Basin, the busiest field in Texas and a big beneficiary of increased investment in shale reserves. It currently pumps 2.4 million barrels of oil a day, but production could grow to a peak of as much as 10 million in future years. At the current rate of disposal in the area, that would mean 30 million to 50 million barrels of dirty water every day, enough to fill the Empire State Building eight times a day.', 'Disposal can be expensive, especially with oil prices around $50 a barrel, half the price in 2014. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was trading down 15 cents at $49.74 a barrel as of 1:19 p.m. Singapore time on Friday.', 'Most drillers hire oilfield-service companies to get rid of the wastewater. Trucks dump the water into holes dug deep underground that lead to porous formations, thousands of feet below the drinking-water table. In Texas, the service costs about\xa0$1.50 to $2.50 a barrel. Capobianco, in an interview, said he can reduce that to roughly $1, once his pipelines are in place.', '“We are at a tipping point,” where water is set to join oil and natural gas as a key commodity for the industry’s pipeline companies, said Capobianco, who is also a former board member for the general partner of ', '. “Water is at a very nascent stage.

Last month, WaterBridge\xa0acquired EnWater Solutions LLC for an undisclosed amount, its first acquisition of a water-pipeline company in the Permian Basin. It will be announcing another deal in the next two to four weeks, Capobianco said.', 'Capper said she’s counted roughly 25 companies similar to Capobianco’s that are in various stages of development for water pipelines. “It’s a market that is developing for very good reason,” she said. “It’ll be here for the long run."', 'Wastewater isn’t the only goal. After Capobianco builds out a bigger network of disposal pipelines, the next major step will be an integrated system of management that cleans and recycles it for use in future production, he said. In fracking -- a technique that helped fuel the U.S. oil boom -- water, sand and chemicals are forced into the ground to loosen oil trapped in layers of shale rock.', 'The industry’s water use isn’t without controversy. In Oklahoma, where as many as 20 barrels of water are produced for every barrel of oil, heavy injections of wastewater underground have been blamed for all the earthquakes in the state. Using pipelines might help address that problem, by providing access to areas better suited for disposal.', '“We’re a whole lot better about producing oil and gas than we used to be,” Capper said. “And when you produce more oil and gas, you get more water with it.”']

Same-store sales have fallen 13 of the last 14 quarters at its namesake chain, and they’ve tumbled the past 10 straight quarters at Banana Republic. The brands were tired, and something needed to be done.', 'Art Peck', 'So Peck made one of the biggest decisions of his two-year stint as CEO: He would ', ' about 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores -- locations he calls “terminally ill” -- and refocus on two newer brands: Old Navy and Athleta.', 'In many ways, the move was a long time coming. Old Navy has been the company’s biggest division for the last three fiscal years, and it’s estimated to account for about a third of the ', '’s value. But the shift away from Gap and Banana Republic puts more pressure on Old Navy to be the company’s consistent -- and long-term -- growth engine, meaning there’s less margin for error.', '“We’re certainly not giving up on Gap or Banana, but we’re acknowledging the world continues to change,” Peck, 62, said in an interview.\xa0“And those are the two most mature brands in the portfolio.”', 'The plan isn’t a “reboot” of the company, Peck said. Instead, he’s “drawing a line in the sand.” The idea is to focus on the areas with the most potential for fueling growth -- rather than having unrealistic expectations for the older divisions.', 'When Old Navy ', ', it was meant to help Gap target families with lower-priced merchandise. Gap executive Mickey Drexler, who later ran ', ', helped start the brand and it relied on quirky marketing campaigns to stand out. Campy ads featuring Vogue fashion editor Carrie Donovan and celebrities such as Morgan Fairchild -- along with a dog named Magic -- quickly turned the chain into a household name in the U.S.', 'In later years, the chain rode the wave of “athleisure,” the trend of wearing sweatpants and other athletic clothing as casual wear. Athleta, Gap’s yoga apparel chain, also has benefited from that shift.', 'But Old Navy -- with its lower prices -- ultimately cannibalized the Gap,\xa0said Liz Dunn, head of consulting firm Talmage Advisors.\xa0As Gap’s sales declined, the company had to accept losing customers to its sister brand, Dunn said. Otherwise, shoppers might head for competitors.', '“It’s been a smart trade over the long term,” she said. “While they didn’t initially envision that being Old Navy’s role, it’s probably better than the alternative.”', 'Old Navy now contributes about three-quarters of the company’s profit, compared with Gap’s 7 percent,\xa0according to Jefferies LLC analyst Randal Konik.

He plans to open 270 Old Navy, outlet and Athleta locations in their stead.', 'As part of the push, Gap expects Old Navy’s sales to top $10 billion in the coming years, with Athleta exceeding $1 billion.', 'The San Francisco-based company got another boost on Tuesday when Konik said the Old Navy focus could lift the stock to $39 within a year. It climbed 6.4 percent to $27.61 that day.', 'In all, Gap shares have gained 25 percent this year.', 'Investors had been valuing the organization as if the Gap chain was driving the bus, Konik said in a report. And yet, most of the profit is coming from Old Navy. As shareholders re-evaluate the company, he expects the shares to continue rising.', 'But Old Navy has had its own stumbles.', 'Sales ', ' in 2015 after brand president Stefan Larsson quit to become CEO of Ralph Lauren Corp. He had worked to bring more of a fashion sense to the division, and his abrupt departure left Old Navy in upheaval. Growth wasn’t restored until the middle of 2016.', 'The key to the chain’s future success is speed.\xa0It competes with fast-fashion companies like H&M, and those chains have a very quick metabolism. Clothing racks have to be stocked with the latest styles, or shoppers will go elsewhere.', 'To stay relevant, Old Navy has put a big emphasis on accelerating its supply chain. About half of the chain’s products can go from idea to shelf in six to 15 weeks. The rest of the brand has a turnaround time of about 22 weeks, Peck said earlier this month. The apparel industry averages 36 to 42 weeks, he said.', 'Gap is now looking to get its other brands to use the same approach.', '“It’s just better suited to modern retailing,”\xa0said Bridget Weishaar, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.', 'But even if Old Navy has the right formula, opening up hundreds of new stores could bring fresh risks. If consumers shift away from sporty clothing, the company will be more exposed than before.', '“Just because it’s working now doesn’t mean it’s going to work 10 years from now,” Weishaar said.', 'Gap has been slowly shrinking its footprint in malls, which have been a key vulnerability. Shoppers are making few trips to\xa0enclosed shopping centers, making it harder for retailers to count on consistent traffic. The company has eliminated 650 stores since 2005 and slashed its square footage by 5 million square feet.', 'In the remaining stores, Peck is counting on revamped merchandise and eye-catching prices to attract shoppers. For the back-to-school season, Old Navy sold polo shirts for $3.', 'He’s also looking to product innovations to help revive sales at Gap’s older brands.', 'A product at Banana Republic called the Rapid Movement Chino has been successful, Peck said. The pants wick away sweat and and can stretch to be more comfortable, but they’re still appropriate for work.', 'Gap still has a painful transition ahead, though.', 'Peck estimates that there are 300 to 350 Gap stores that are still quite healthy. That leaves about 500 other stores in North America, some of which are outlet locations. But more than anything, Gap needs to present itself better, Peck said.', '“I want fewer, better Gap stores,” he said.']

We took up our silk pantaloons. We were in the no-time zone. We could be ourselves again. And who ourselves were—who ourselves are—we were keen to find out.” Harrison, who had already taken up the sitar with Ravi Shankar in India in 1966, was finding his spiritual center in Indian philosophy.\xa0', '“The Beatles were the avatars for our generation,” Saltzman said. Their trip East “opened the floodgates of interest in travel and meditation and yoga and the spiritual life for millions of people around the world who knew nothing about Rishikesh and meditation.”', 'After finishing his sitar practice, Saltzman recalled, “George\xa0said, ‘I get higher meditating than I ever did on drugs.’ And then after a while, he said, ‘We’re the Beatles. We have all the money you could ever dream of, we have all the fame we could ever wish for.

Felix Baumgartner and Martin Frei were real innovators for launching a company wholly predicated on an unusual mechanism and system for displaying time—and they did it way back in 1997. It's tough to overstate how different things were back then. The whole idea of innovative, modern horology was basically unheard of at the time, and Baumgartner and Frei are a big part of why we now take this whole segment of the watch market for granted. The UR-105 Streamliner is the result of some reflecting on the early days of their company, so let's look a little closer.", 'In 1997, Frei and Baumgartner had only recently hatched Urwerk, but Frei left Switzerland and set out for New York. He’d graduated from the College of Arts and Design in Lucerne, and wanted to set up a shop in the creative hub of late nineties Brooklyn. Felix, meanwhile, was living in Geneva. Neither of these guys knew for sure whether they should continue with a watchmaking pipe dream that was eating into their savings.', "Felix visited Martin in New York, and, as they tell it now, they wandered the city streets, taking pictures and gazing at the Art Deco buildings, and, according to Urwerk's press release, the city’s “gleaming subway.” Perhaps it gleamed 20 years ago, but I can't think of any New Yorker who would reach for such a word today. But I digress …", 'The UR-105 CT is a timepiece inspired by these initial impressions of New York, its magnificent Art Deco skyscrapers, and the metallic tubes ferrying commuters through a subterranean labyrinth. Its eight-sided shape recalls the metallic ribbing along a subway car and the skyward-reaching lines of the Empire State Building.', 'Situated in the middle of the lines that adorn the top of the UR-105’s oblong octogonal case is a catch, which you can slide open to reveal the mechanism that guides the wandering hour mechanism. This kind of display is textbook Urwerk, but the specific openworked version presented in the UR-105 CT is something new.', '“The UR-105 CT is a watch with a fleixble design,” say Baumgartner. “When it is closed, it looks austere, with only the time indication visible. Open the protective cover and you delve into a metallic environment that is quite cold. The Streamliner’s carousel has been completely redesigned, becoming lighter, stronger, and far more effective.”', 'On the dial, you can also read the the amount of power remaining in reserve (out of a total of 48 hours), as well as the digital seconds, which are meted out in increments of ten. This mechanism was manufactured using photolithography and has been openworked to achieve of total weight of less than a tenth of a gram.', "As you’ve seen before from Urwerk, there are pneumatic turbines on the back that govern the self-winding rate. You can set these according to your anticipated activity level via a simple lever mechanism. If you decide to do something crazy like play golf with this watch, you’ll want to turn the self-winding all the way to stop to avoid putting stress on the mechanism. Also, if you decided to do that, give us a call—we'd love to see the watch in action.", 'The movement here is the selfwinding UR 5.03 caliber, which, for all of its unusual features, runs at a conventionial rate of 28,800 vph. Some of the exotic materials used to construct this caliber include beryllium bronze for the satellite hours on Geneva crosses, aluminum for the openworked carousel, and an alloy called ARCAP for the aforementioned super light digital seconds display.', 'The UR-105 CT Streamliner comes in two versions, both of which will set you back 65,000 CHF (approximately $68,000 at time of publishing). One is in titanium and mirror-polished steel, while the other is titanium and black PVD-coated steel.

['The Hinckley Dasher.', 'Photographer: Christopher Churchill/Supervision', 'When Bob Dylan went electric, jamming ', ' on his sunburst Fender Stratocaster at Rhode Island’s 1965 Newport Folk Festival, he changed the world and gave a jolt to a field (and a town) known mostly for being staid and traditional. Now\xa0Newport is the scene of another electrification, one that may have a similarly seismic effect.', 'On Thursday\xa0', '\xa0', ', the almost\xa090-year-old yacht builder, based in Portsmouth, R.I., introduced the Dasher, ', ', taking its moniker from the company’s first “picnic-style” boat.', '“This isn’t just an existing design, where we dropped a couple of electric motors in,” says Scott Bryant, Hinckley’s director of new product development. “The boat has been designed, ground up, for electric propulsion.”', 'At 6,500 pounds, the Dasher is the lightest boat Hinckley has ever built; the similarly dimensioned Center Console 29 runabout tips the scales at roughly 8,000 lbs. This weight savings was achieved through liberal use of carbon fiber, both in the carbon-epoxy hull, conceived\xa0by noted boat designer Michael Peters, and in the carbon-fiber stringers, which lend it structure and rigidity.', 'Varnished teak, a dense hardwood that’s integral to Hinckley’s luxury aesthetic, has been replaced with Artisanal Teak, the company’s trademarked name for a molded composite structure hand-painted with wood grain to look “literally indistinguishable from real teak,” Bryant says.\xa0Pioneering use of lightweight materials is actually baked deep into the Hinckley\xa0heritage. It was among the first commercial boat builders to integrate fiberglass in its\xa0production in the 1950s.', 'While much about the Dasher is new, electric boats have been around for quite a while. Before the 1930s\xa0you were more likely to see an electric-powered boat than one driven by an internal combustion motor. Today, the electric boats you’re most likely to see are designed for casual,\xa0calm-water cruising, such as the ', ', which has\xa0a top speed of 6 miles per hour. High-speed electric boats tend toward\xa0the experimental and promotional: The Swedish ', '\xa0concept features hydrofoils to reduce drag\xa0and, thus, energy consumption, while the one-off ', ' was powered by a dozen Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive motors.', 'Whether they’re\xa0fast or slow, you’re still more likely to see them in Europe—where, says Bryant, “there are several lakes where you’re not allowed to have a petrol-based platform. You can row your boat, or sail your boat, or you have electric propulsion. In the U.S.\xa0it’s a little bit less prominent, but we believe that’s going to be coming sooner than later.”', 'The Dasher will be propelled by twin 80-horsepower Deep Blue 80i 1800', 'motors from German company Torqeedo, each powered by a 40-kilowatt-hour BMW i3 lithium ion battery. That combination will produce a range of about 40 miles (35 nautical miles) at a cruising speed of 10 mph, or 8.6 knots, and up to 25 miles (22 NM) at speeds of 18 to 27 mph (15.6 to 23.5 knots). As a rough comparison, a similar-size\xa0boat, such as a Boston Whaler 285 Conquest Pilothouse with twin Mercury 225 Verado engines on the back, will burn 9.5 gallons of fuel per hour while traveling at roughly 10 mph.', 'To assuage any so-called range anxiety, the single touchscreen console of the Dasher will include a GPS display of the boat’s location, surrounded by a circle that grows or shrinks in size, indicating your remaining range at any given time, depending on how fast you’re going and how far you’ve gone.\xa0Also on the console will be a retractable windshield and Jet Stick joystick, which makes delicate docking maneuvers ', '\xa0simple,\xa0by allowing fine control of motors and a subaquatic thruster.', 'One advantage Hinckley—and the nascent electric boat market in general—has over electric cars is that\xa0marinas already provide a well-established charging infrastructure thanks to ubiquitous dockside power sources. When connected to a pair of standard 50-amp lines, the Dasher can gain a full charge in four hours—about the time it takes for a leisurely lunch at the marina and a swim at the beach.', 'More likely,\xa0the Dasher will be “all about having a ‘point A to point A’ experience, which is very different from cars, where most people don’t go out just to go driving,”\xa0Bryant says.\xa0“It’s synonymous to going out for a ride on your motorcycle.”', 'Pricing will be on a par with Hinckley’s other vessels of its size, such as the 29-foot runabouts—upwards of half a million dollars, according to a company spokesperson. There will not be a price premium. The first test rides aboard the prototype won’t happen until later this month (so speed, handling abilities, and energy consumption ratings are based on Hinckley’s statements), while the\xa0first deliveries are anticipated for the summer of 2018.', 'By then, Bryant expects the Dasher to exceed its current range. “When we started this project [a little more than two years ago], our test boat actually used a totally different battery, similar in weight to the existing i3 batteries that we have in there now. But it had about about 30 percent less power density, which translated to 30 percent less range,” he says.\xa0“So, really, we are riding a development wave in ways that’s pretty significant right now in the marketplace.”', 'Like Tesla’s original Roadster, the Dasher is a market-ready vision of what post-petrol transportation could look like—fully functional, but with one foot still in the world of proof of concept. Already, Hinckley is looking ahead.', '“I don’t believe that Dasher will be our only electric-propulsion product,” says Bryant. “I think what we’re looking to do is to incorporate a bunch of the features that we’re introducing on Dasher into our other products. There’s so much going on in the automotive space, and just in the energy-storage space right now, that to not be a part of it is just silly.”', 'Even in the staid world of classic yacht design—as the man said, the times they are a-changin’.']

The company is also working to upgrade the interiors of passenger cars and will need to invest more on engineering work for Northeast Corridor\xa0tracks and other infrastructure, said Anderson, who moved to Washington this month.', 'Congress created Amtrak in 1970 via the Rail Passenger Service Act, and train service commenced the following year. The company’s ridership has been heavily concentrated in the Northeast, with service connecting New York, Boston, and Washington. That’s also the only region where Amtrak operates its high-speed Acela service, which began in 2000.

Ultimately, Anderson said, Amtrak’s goal is to reach break-even on an operating basis within the next few years.', 'Anderson’s position on subsidies is noteworthy. During his nine years at Delta, he became famous for the ferocity with which he battled subsidies he believed competitors enjoyed, from sources including\xa0the Export-Import Bank and a trio of Middle Eastern governments that U.S. airlines accuse of giving unfair aid to their carriers. Under Anderson, Delta led an effort to cut off federal support for the ExIm\xa0Bank, which was a key element in many sales of Boeing Co. jets abroad.', 'Amtrak, meanwhile, provides an “essential service” for many Americans, Anderson said, and enjoys broad Congressional support.

['You learn a lot of things—few of them pleasant—when selling a house. When I put\xa0my brownstone on the market a few years ago, I hired a team of professional window cleaners to come and give my windows a good going over. Burly guys with the precision of figure skaters ran soapy squeegees and T-bars encased in fluffy sleeves over the glass, doing more to improve the look of my home than all the dusting, mopping, and HGTV-inspired staging I could muster.\xa0', 'The lesson was twofold: Clean windows make a huge difference, and keeping them that way is harder than it looks, especially if you’re doing it yourself. That’s why cleaning the windows of my apartment has earned a perpetual place at the top of my to-do list, above even the more necessary tasks of repainting and regrouting.', 'And so I was thrilled when I saw the Winbot 950—essentially, a Roomba broken free of gravity. While the field of floor cleaners is cluttered, far fewer companies have gone vertical: There’s the ', '\xa0and the skyscraper-ready ', ', by Swiss company Serbot\xa0AG, and that’s about it. How would this device, made by Chinese robotics company Ecovacs\xa0Robotics, keep my windows sparkling without squeegee acrobatics on my part?', 'The Winbot 950 works by affixing itself to a pane of glass, using an inbuilt fan for suction, like a vacuum, and moving itself around with a pair of rubber tank treads. Surrounding the fan and treads is a circular squeegee, and then a removable, washable, microfiber cloth that you spritz with a spray window cleaner. There are edge sensors in the corner\xa0and a handle on top with a start/pause button.', 'Since the Winbot 950 is rather large—about 11 inches square\xa0and just shy of five\xa0pounds—it must be plugged in\xa0to maintain sufficient suction to keep it attached. It has enough battery power to keep itself on the window for 15\xa0minutes, should power go out amid cleaning.\xa0The 14-foot-long\xa0power cord determines the theoretical limit to the window size a\xa0Winbot can clean: about 175 square feet.', 'My double-hung windows, however, were considerably smaller, with each pane of glass about 3.5 feet\xa0square. I plugged in the Winbot and held it up to the glass and pressed the start button. It took just under four minutes to clean the 12-and-a-quarter square feet I’d assigned it. At one point, the border of a rolled up shade created a barrier it couldn’t see or navigate away from. It beeped balefully until I used the included remote control to manually guide it back down to a place at which I could restart the cleaning.', 'Cleaning the outsides of my third-story windows necessitated use of the included tether, which fixes to the Winbot\xa0at\xa0one end and to glass on the other, using a large suction cup. For a moment, I imagined the Winbot losing grip and bungee jumping off my building, maybe swinging through my downstairs neighbor’s window like a wrecking ball. That, fortunately, never happened. It just sucked on, like a household ramora, and puttered about for an additional four minutes.', 'Was it worth the $400 price tag? Perhaps if I had giant, flat picture windows, it would be. As things are, I’m better off making do with my Windex and squeegee.\xa0Or just leave it to the professionals.']

(Alas, its engines are diesel-electric, not nuclear-powered.)', 'And unlike a yacht, which is just going to sit there on top of the water, floating around like a $200 million chunk of burnished driftwood, the M7 can dive to 1,500 feet and cruise underwater\xa0at 20 knots. The real excitement, as Sebastian the Crab once sang, is “under the sea.”', 'Life may be better down where it’s wetter, but the M7 will cost you. There’s no precise price tag yet, says Christian Gumpold, chief executive\xa0officer of\xa0Migaloo.\xa0But\xa0the $2.3 billion figure mentioned in this ', ' is close. “This would make it for sure to the most expensive private object worldwide,” Gumpold\xa0told us via\xa0email.', 'The M7 is not the only submarine available to those rich enough to afford one. For a couple of decades, companies such as Triton Submarines, DeepFlight Adventures, U-Boat Worx\xa0BV, and Seamagine\xa0Hydrospace Corp. have been producing and selling “submersibles.” These are smaller vehicles,\xa0capable of taking from two to eight passengers\xa0thousands of feet down to explore the ocean for hours at a time.

Three companies—', ', the Florida-based ', ', and ', '\xa0in the Netherlands—produce sub designs\xa0that aspiring Bond villains dream of: capable of traveling 1,000 miles or more, luxuriously appointed, and the kind of underwater headquarters from which you can plot world domination, or maybe just host friends for a week of exploration.', 'As you might expect, private submarines are phenomenally expensive. U.S. Submarines’ Nomad 1000—which seats 10 to 24, has a range of 1,000 nautical miles, and can dive to 1,000 feet—begins at $6.5 million. Its top-of-the-line, 213-foot-long Phoenix 1000, which has more than 5,000 square feet of interior, is estimated to cost $90 million.', 'So while dozens of private submersibles are bobbing around the deep, there are currently no private luxury subs in existence. For all the renderings zipping around the Internet, subs such as the M7 and the Phoenix 1000 remain (mostly) theoretical.', '“We’re not building anything right now,” said\xa0L. Bruce Jones, the founder and CEO of U.S. Submarines, adding that his company, which is affiliated with Triton, is focusing on submersibles “because that’s where the market is.”', '“It seems like a massively expensive engineering exercise—and an unproven one—in the recreational sector,” said\xa0Stewart Campbell, editor of ', '. “Yachting is often a volume game—how much space can you pack into your hull and superstructure? There’s a cost-per-gross-tonne calculation that the superyacht world understands. I imagine with one of these big submersibles, that equation goes out the window.

They all also claim perfect records, with about 1 million passengers per year going on dives as tourists.', 'Of the three manufacturers, only Ocean Submarine (which supplies subs to the military)\xa0 is\xa0under contract to complete a civilian vessel, for what CEO Martin van Eijk calls “a very rich client.” Set to be delivered in 2018, the 64-foot Neyk L3 can seat up to 20 passengers, depending on the configuration, with a bar, galley, and library. (Van Eijk did not know which books will go into\xa0the library.)', 'The L3 may be smaller than Migaloo’s offerings, but its size offers some advantages. The company’s idea of luxury is, according to its brochures, about “more than Connolly leather.” As with, say, a Lamborghini, this is about comfort and control: Vertical thrusters let the L3 remain in one place, despite ocean currents; landing gear allows the sub to pull up on beaches (no marina necessary); and the ride is quiet and precise, with a range of 500 to 1,500 nautical miles. Plus, it’s only 20 million euros\xa0($23.8 million), practically a bargain. (Buy two!)', 'Learning to pilot these subs—or rather, training a crew to pilot them—is essential. In the U.S., pilots need to have a master’s license, but there’s more to it than that. “When a\xa0submarine is on the surface, it’s the same like another ship,” van Eijk said. “But when you go down under, you need some rules to understand.”', 'Ocean Submarines, he said, has a German training center, with the same simulator as airplanes. “We can do the same interior as the cockpits, so the client can see how exactly the submarine will work,” he said. The training typically takes four months.', 'Once you’ve got your sub and your trained crew, you can go wherever you like, the manufacturers told me. There are no specific legal restrictions on civilian subs anywhere in the world. Which is not to say coast guards won’t take note\xa0of your presence.', '“When you bring a submersible into someone else’s territorial waters, not everybody is as enthusiastic about allowing you to go diving,” said\xa0Patrick Lahey, the founder and president of ', '. “The areas that people seem to be most concerned about submersibles being used are Greece and France, because they have antiquities on the bottom and they’re concerned that a person that owns a submersible might be going down and taking things that might be an important part of history.” (Mechanical grabbing arms and diver lock-out chambers are popular add-ons for most subs.)', 'There is a way to assuage\xa0concerns, Lahey said.\xa0“Involve the local authorities in what you’re doing, both to assure them you’re not there to plunder their antiquities but to give them an opportunity to dive in their own waters and to see things maybe they’ve never seen themselves.”', 'If that doesn’t work, you could always invite them for a dip in one of your jacuzzis, or a midnight screening of the new Star Wars movie at your sub’s open-air cinema. And if the paparazzi show up to spy, you can do what mere superyacht owners never can: Dive.']

['As the European Central Bank prepares to slow its bond-buying program, policy makers are considering softening the blow by highlighting a related measure -- the reinvestment of maturing debt.', 'An average of 15 billion euros ($18 billion) a month of assets held under quantitative easing will mature next year, according to euro-area central bank officials who said the ', ' at the last Governing Council meeting. While the plan to reinvest that cash has long been a part of policy, the ECB is concerned that investors are under-appreciating its impact, three people said. A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment.', 'Emphasizing the flow of spending needed to maintain its stock of holdings gives the ECB a way to play down a key risk burdening policy makers -- that any decision to start reducing net asset purchases might tighten markets. The dilemma is that more than 2 trillion euros of QE so far has provided robust economic growth, spurring calls in some quarters to end bond buying, but it hasn’t yet led to sustained inflation.', '“I do constantly hear people asking whether it is time to start tapering,” ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said in an interview with De Tijd published on Saturday. “But underlying inflation remains too low. We have to be patient and persevere with our policy, a substantial stimulus is still necessary. Everyone agrees that we have to make sure that the reduction of the stimulus takes place in an orderly manner, without any excessive shocks.”', 'The last time the Governing Council adjusted QE, it extended purchases by nine months and slowed the monthly pace to 60 billion euros from 80 billion euros, citing an improved economic outlook. That schedule comes to an end in December, and President Mario Draghi has said the bulk of the decisions for 2018 will be taken in October. Praet said the ECB will have to “be very careful about the words we use.”', 'While the ECB ', ' inflation of 1.2 percent next year and 1.5 percent in 2019, compared with a goal of just under 2 percent, most economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict purchases will soon start to be phased out.', 'Yet should the monthly pace be slowed -- for example to 30 billion euros -- the ECB could try to mitigate any negative impact by noting that total spending including reinvestments would average about 45 billion euros.', '“Sounds like we could be in store for a ‘super-stealthy taper’,”said Richard Barwell,\xa0an economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management in London. “The second stage of the taper could be downplayed as a mere adjustment just like the first, even though going from 60 to 30 billion a month in January opens up the possibility of a hard stop in July, and now the true deceleration in net bond buying could be camouflaged by focusing attention on gross purchases.”', 'It’s not yet decided whether the ECB will disclose the specific value of reinvestments when it lays out next year’s plans, the people said, asking not to be named because the Governing Council’s deliberations are confidential. Details such as whether replacement purchases must match the nationality and duration of the maturing bonds also have yet to be agreed on, they said.', 'The ECB has two more policy meetings scheduled before the end of the year, on Oct. 26 and Dec. 14. Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said this week that it’s time to take a decision “now” on scaling back bond purchases at the beginning of next year. Slovenian Governor Bostjan Jazbec said a decision to reduce buying will “inevitably” come but was postponed because economic developments don’t yet support it.', 'Draghi, who has previously urged patience and prudence in communicating the withdrawal of stimulus, is scheduled to speak in Frankfurt on Sept. 21 and Dublin the next day.', 'The reinvestments also offer potential room for flexibility on the type of purchases, which could help the ECB overcome any shortages.', 'Over half a trillion euros of debt issued by the top four beneficiary nations in the QE program -- Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- is due for redemption next year, with roughly 125 billion euros owned by the ECB, according to ', '.', 'Holdings will total almost 2.3 trillion euros by the end of 2017, and economists have warned that some asset classes such as German debt will soon become scarce. The ECB has already been deviating from the so-called capital key, which links the volumes of public-sector purchases by national central banks to the relative sizes of the currency bloc’s economies. That has allowed it to buy more debt from countries such as Italy and France, where availability is greater.', 'One consequence of the higher purchases is that they help depress yields in those nations, reducing the financing burden on governments. According to BNP’s Barwell, the pending discussions on reinvestments mean that bonus could continue.', '“Once you set the precedent that reinvestments can be redeployed around the euro zone then you have the possibility that the composition of the bond portfolio could continue to shift toward Italy even when QE is done,” he said. “That would be a silver lining for Italy on an otherwise dark cloud of premature exit.”']
